# First-n8n-workflow
My first n8n workflow guided by 9x tutorial

This is my first experience designing an AI workflow using n8n. This is the agent that we created in a workshop given by 9x. The idea is to create an example using nx8, AirTable, FireCrawl and an LLM of choice (in this case I used Gemini 2.5 Pro).

The resulting workflow can be seen in the image belos.

This repository contains the JSON file for this workflow, as well as the instructions given to create it.

Below is a link to a YouTube video with the recorded session of the workshop.

The API keys have been altered, you should create and use your own.
